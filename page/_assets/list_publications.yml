  abstract: "We solve the Gaussian Variational Approximation cubic complexity by defining a deterministic flow. It allows to use low-rank approximation (without diagonal) and obtain exact guarantees. Additionally, we show that using particles helps getting a more stable convergence and a higher accuracy."
