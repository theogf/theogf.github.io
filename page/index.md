\begin{section}{title="Bio"}

Théo Galy-Fajou is a doctor in Machine Learning specialized in [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) methods.
He is particularly interested in approximate Bayesian inference methods like sampling, applications to Gaussian processes and online learning.
Throughout his Ph.D., Théo developed numerous [open source projects](#open_source_projects) in [Julia](https://julialang.org) and dived deep into software development.
He is currently working as a freelancer, in particular with [PlantingSpace](https://planting.space).

\begin{section}{title="News"}

- I finally defended my thesis on the 07th of July! I will upload the final version of the thesis soon.
- I joined the [PlantingSpace](https://planting.space) team in April as Julia software developer and Bayesian researcher!
- A new paper got accepted at the [Entropy journal](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy)! Check out ["Flexible and Efficient Inference with Particles for the Variational Gaussian Approximation"](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/8/990) with [Valerio Perrone](https://sites.google.com/view/valerioperrone/) and Manfred Opper.
- I gave a short poster presentation on my work on [Turkie.jl](https://github.com/theogf/Turkie.jl) for [JuliaCon 2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/), you can find the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu9GRus7-FM).
- I gave a talk at the Cambridge Machine Learning Reading Group and it's been recorded, check it out on here on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQGSFyzi6A)
- Two papers were accepted for the [AABI Symposium](http://approximateinference.org/): [Gaussian Density Parametrization Flow: Particle and Stochastic Approaches](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LclKtSfmf9I) with [Valerio Perrone](https://sites.google.com/view/valerioperrone/) and Manfred Opper and [Evidence Estimation by Kullback-Leibler Integration for Flow-Based Methods](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LclKtSfmf9I) with [Nikolai Zaki](https://www.sfb1294.de/nikolai-zaki) and Manfred Opper.
