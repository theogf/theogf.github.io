# Théo Galy-Fajou
## PhD Student in Machine Learning @ TU Berlin

Interest in Gaussian Processes, Bayesian Inference, Online Learning and Julia programming.

## News

- Two papers were accepted for the [AABI Symposium](http://approximateinference.org/): [Gaussian Density Parametrization Flow: Particle and Stochastic Approaches](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LclKtSfmf9I) with Valerio Perrone and Manfred Opper and [Evidence Estimation by Kullback-Leibler Integration for Flow-Based Methods](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LclKtSfmf9I) with Nikolai Zaki and Manfred Opper.
- [JuliaCon 2020](https://live.juliacon.org/) is happening this week and here are the two talks I have given about my ongoing work on [KernelFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/KernelFunctions.jl) [(presentation here)](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/YY9QEJ) and [AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl](https://github.com/theogf/AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl) [(presentation here)](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/CE7FZA).
- I started a new blog called ["Bayesian Tribulations"](./bayesiantribulations), it's very experimental at the moment but if you want have a look! I used [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) to generate it!
- My paper ["Adaptive Inducing Point Selection for Gaussian Processes"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IPTUBfY_b2WElTWBIVU4lrbHcXnbTWdB/view?usp=sharing) has been accepted for the Continual Learning Workshop of ICML 2020. You can check this [introduction video](https://youtu.be/aR_viPWNv1U) for more info. Note that this is still a work in progress!
- Our paper ["Automated Augmented Conjugate Inference for Non-conjugate Gaussian Process Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11451) got accepted at the AISTATS 2020 conference, check it out! Here is a [short explaining Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/theo_gf/status/1233082060430020609). 

- Our paper ["Multi-Class Gaussian Process Classification Made Conjugate: Efficient Inference via Data Augmentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09670) got accepted for the UAI conference 2019, see you in Tel Aviv

- I have a few projects in my bag if you would be interested to make a master project with Pr. Opper and I. Check out [this page](https://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/diplom_bachelor_master_und_studienarbeiten/masterarbeiten/parameter/en/) or contact me directly if you are interested

- Recently gave a short talk at [Berlin Julia Meetup](https://julia-users-berlin.github.io/)  (join!), here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c5DZlq0rZUyELFPgI4bl0Lw7uUAuDLTHsCE7u-jkZG0/edit?usp=sharing)  and the [notebook is here](files/presentation_julia_meetup.ipynb)

- Our paper ["Efficient Gaussian Process Classification Using Polya-Gamma Data Augmentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06383) got accepted at the AAAI conference 2019!

- We have a journal club to speak about Bayesian inference and Machine Learning papers. You can find [more informations here](journalclub)
